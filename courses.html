        <p><b>what makes one college course more enjoyable than another?</b><br>
           <b>Unquestionably, college courses provide students with a great variety of learning opportunities. However, proper mastery of particular courses much depends on the student’s motivation. Therefore, most students focus on the courses relevant to their future professions. Social studies are popular with the students of human faculties, while technical courses will get more appreciation among the students of IT, engineering and computer departments. Besides mastering specialization courses, it is, however, rather important to obtain universal knowledge in various supplementary subjects listed in the curriculum. This means that college courses provide a wide scope of studies that develop students both as intelligent individuals and future professionals.</b></p>
